# dcase2022
Submission for task 2 of the DCASE challenge 2022 (https://dcase.community/challenge2022/task-unsupervised-anomalous-sound-detection-for-machine-condition-monitoring).

To run the code, you need to download the development dataset, additional training dataset and the evaluation dataset and store the files in an './eval_data' and a './dev_data' folder. The implementation is based on Tensorflow 2.x. Just start the main script for training and evaluation.
